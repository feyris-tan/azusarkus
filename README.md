# azusarkus project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you don't know about Quarkus go check it out, it's really cool: https://quarkus.io/

You probably stumbled upon this by accident. This project is just me experimenting how I can use quarkus to improve my "azusa" Application.
